  In this study, the PyQt5 tool was used to design a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the Windows 11 system, which was combined with the student classroom behavior recognition model to analyze and display the recognition results.
  The functional architecture of the system is designed to achieve concise, efficient and accurate classroom behavior analysis, mainly including the following two core functions:
  Behavior Recognition The student classroom behavior recognition function is the core of the system. The recognition model proposed in this study is deeply integrated with the system, and it has the ability to monitor students' classroom behavior in a delayed and real-time manner. Users can upload image information through detection pictures, videos or cameras, select recognition models and start detection. The system processes inputs at a frequency of once per second, completes recognition quickly and accurately, and provides users with instant feedback.
  Result Statistics The system can efficiently organize and analyze the recognition results and present the data in intuitive charts. In addition, the system provides a data saving function, which is convenient for users to export the results for analysis or archiving. The exported results are shown in the figure above.

 Installation Tutorial
 Install PyQt5: This study installed it through PyCharm settings
 Click File -> Settings.
 In the settings interface, select Project -> Python Interpreter.
 Click the + button on the right and search for PyQt5.
 Select PyQt5 and click Install Package.
 After the installation is complete, PyCharm will automatically recognize and add PyQt5 to the project.
 Check that the installation was successful: Check that PyQt5 is installed by running pip list in the terminal.
 
  Writing PyQt5 applications in PyCharm
  Create a Python file:
  In the PyCharm project, right-click the project folder, select New -> Python File, and name the file main.py.
  Write code: In the newly created main.py file, enter the following code of this system: The specific code will be uploaded after the paper is accepted.
